# Projects
This is the path with some of my projects I've spent time and passion on, starting with the simplest and evolving.  
## Odds of winning the academy award (2019)
is my first work where I used the empricial techniques, at the time only aware of simple OLS. I ended up designing an LPM, on the data collected by myself. The question of predicting a best picture winner had been on my mind for a long time by then, and still pops up sometime. Since The Academy modified their selection criteria recently, and in the light of the other events I am no longer sure that the model holds that well.  
## Relative evaluation of Californian wines, from *wine enthusiast* data (2020)
This is the first complete data science project. It involves full-fledged EDA, followed by modeling and interpretation. In situations when you have two bottles of wine and you wonder which one is more expensive, the model can come in handy. It would take in the characteristics of a wine such as the geography, winery, year, parse the description for the qualities as "oaked" or "reserved". I also got involved with text mining and NLP here, by extracting important word combinations from the taster's review, and evaluating their sentiment regarding the wine. The final model selected is a LASSO regression that outperformed other methods on the test set.
## Real estate prices in Melbourne (2021)
Is a hedonic analysis of the initial price boom in real estate prices in Melbourne.
## Evaluating school effects in Budapest schools (2021)
Here I use provided to me school level data to evaluate a particular high-school's effect on the students math test scores. This can be better exploited via using panel data methods such as FD. Furthermore, the propensity scores can be estimated via FE and then added to the Causal Forest model as weights.  

## Does it take a pandemic to shift to telehealth, and is it here to stay? (2021)
This is my undergraduate thesis, please find the abstract for it. I also provide a short, rephrased vesrion of my results.  

## Revisiting Treatment Effects with Causal Forests (in progress)
