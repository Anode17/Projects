# TRANSITION TO TELEHEALTH:
Does it take a global pandemic to make the shift and is it
here to stay? Evaluating current situation
when public data is unavailable

## Abstract  

Since the pandemic broke and demand for healthcare surged, countries experienced
disruptions, particularly in the treatment of non-communicable diseases. This thesis investigates how
telehealth, as a measure to control for surges in healthcare demand, was applied on a broad-scale
and what factors hindered its adoption before. Due to the lack of public data,
I implement text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze daily newspapers in the UK, Australia, and the US. This type of nowcasting allows 
me to take pulse of the situation. It reveals how cancer treatment, and mental health
have been deteriorating combined with lockdowns, and how public sentiment has improved
toward healthcare delivered virtually.
