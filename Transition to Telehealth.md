# TRANSITION TO TELEHEALTH:
Does it take a global pandemic to make the shift and is it
here to stay? Evaluating current situation
when public data is unavailable

## Abstract  

Since the pandemic broke and demand for healthcare surged, countries experienced
disruptions, particularly in the treatment of non-communicable diseases. This thesis investigates how
telehealth, as a measure to control for surges in healthcare demand, was applied on a broad-scale
and what factors hindered its adoption before. Due to the lack of public data,
I implement text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze daily newspapers in the UK, Australia, and the US. This type of nowcasting allows 
me to take pulse of the situation. It reveals how cancer treatment, and mental health
have been deteriorating combined with lockdowns, and how public sentiment has improved
toward healthcare delivered virtually.

With the passage of time, 
does the usage of the word 
increase compared to its 
usage in the previous term?

In The New York Times articles, most important and trending word is shown to be cancer, and the further analysis with bi-grams reveals it is breast cancer in particular. The lockdowns resulted in a steep decline in number of screenings, on average 1/3 YoY. 
### Topics in circulation

The content of predicted themes varies, such that Topic 1 captures relationships between treatment of patients with cancer during the pandemic, hospital visits, and risks.
Topic 5 represents the core words for telemedicine treatment, digital healthcare in general.

### Sentiment Analysis

Topic 1, which was about cancer treatment and risks during the pandemic shows a negative sentiment score for articles of 2020 and 2021, whereas its pre-COVID score was little, yet positive. This may indicate that treatment of the cancer patients during the times of crisis, their diagnosis and therapy has left them unhappy with it. 

Topic 5, which encompasses the telehealth issues, sentiment score in 2020 was negative, compared to the positive pre-COVID articles. Furthermore, sentiment score in the 2021 articles is also positive, meaning we can imply that nowadays public is more positive about the virtual care in general, than it was previously.

Main drivers of the negative sentiment in this topic were words connected to political instabilities of the time.
